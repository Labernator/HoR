# Legendary Lottery

## Why do we need the "Legendary Lottery"?

The answer is similar to the one we gave for experience:
We don't need it ... but everyone loves gambling :)

One minor critizism regarding 40k and the HoR rule set is the lack of equipment improvement. 
There are simply not that many different equipment options to choose from. 
Adding legendary equipment gives players some additional options. 

## When does the lottery take place?

After the first scenario and all subsequent scenarios in a campaign a player may participate in the lottery. 
> Each player can only buy one ticket per turn for the lottery.

## How can I participate in the lottery? 

A lottery ticket is purchased with requisition points.   
`The ticket costs 20 RP.`

## How is the item determined that I get from the lottery? 

Follow the rules for legendary weapon generation explained in the legendary rules supplement to HoR

## Can I sell legendary equipment?

Yes, if you really don't want to keep the stuff you got, you can sell it for half the price of the lottery ticket. (10 RP)
