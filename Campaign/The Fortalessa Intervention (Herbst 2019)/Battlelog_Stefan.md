## Fortalessa, Jewel of the Ilunia Subsector 
Fortalessa the prosperous crownworld of the Ilunia subsector, to the galactic southeast of the Espenæs Sector in Segmentum Tempestus, bordering the Veiled Region. For all of its recorded history, the Ilunia subsector had never known war until 105.M42, when Orks attacked the agri-world of Gadaña. Sub-Sector Lord Governor Meridius Curtanus mobilized his own personal guards to supplement local scratch companies and PDFs from all of the worlds in the Ilunia sub. While the local troops looked to be doing poorly, Governor Curtanus sent a distress signal to the wider Imperium for help. Years of grinding war passed and the whole populace of Ilunia was set to the task of taking back Gadaña and stopping the Orks there. After ten years of bitter war, the last Orks were repulsed from Gadaña when the governor’s own bodyguard, the Segadorian Fusiliers, managed to kill the Ork warlord leading the Waaagh!!! Within a year, kill-teams were permanently stationed on Gadaña to hunt down the feral Orks that would forever plague that world. 

## Relief, At Last? 
A year later, a relief fleet cobbled together by the Adeptus Ministorum, Adeptus Mechanicus and Munitorum arrived in the Ilunia sub to help from the much poorer Ileorosa subsector neighboring Ilunia to the galactic East. When governor Curtanus proudly told them the threat was ended, the lord general appointed to lead the relief fleet was enraged. Why had Curtanus called for help when he didn’t need it? The masters of the relief fleet, the Lord General, Mechanicus Factor Primus and Administratum Lector Primaris, mutually agreed that Ilunia and its governor should bear the cost of transporting the fleet. When Curtanus refused, their forces began pillaging the worlds of the Ilunia sub. To justify their piracy, they increased the tithe grade of Ilunia’s most prosperous world, including Fortalessa to Exactus Extremis. Conscripting roughly 1/10th of the population each Terran year, the entire sub would be devastated. 

## What is a Lord Governor to Do? 
With a trained, war-hardened army fresh from Gadaña, a veteran interplanetary escort flotilla and a scorching wartime economy at his command, advisors to Lord Curtanus had calculated that he could easily fight off the relief fleet and declare his secession from the Imperium, but would it be worth giving up Imperial protection? Should he begin the process of petitioning the Chancellor of the Estates Imperium for redress against these organizations while billions of his people suffer the petty wrath of a greedy lord-general and his cronies? Should the resources of his people feed the corrupt maw that is the Ileorosa subsector? On this side of the galaxy, it would be decades, possibly centuries before the wider Imperium responded. 

## Forces From Beyond 
Unbeknownst to Lord Governor Curtanus, forces are at work on Fortalessa to help him make this decision. These elite kill teams have come to influence the Lord Governor and their machinations will decide the ultimate fate of Fortalessa and the entire Ilunia Subsector.

## … And Out Come the Wolves
What does the Imperium owe its citizens? Safety? Security? Justice? Vast organizations exist to provide these things, yet they all seem to have failed to do so here. Curtanus, who clearly cares about the fate of his people, did exactly what he was supposed to and billions are being punished for it. What right has the Imperium to keep a domain when it has failed to prove worthy of doing so. Why should a citizen pledge fealty and toil frequently unto death in the Emperor’s service if all they can expect is to be stabbed in the back and further exploited when they have done all that is asked of them? No. The Imperium does not deserve Ilunia. It does not deserve Lord Governor Meridius Curtanus. The best hope Ilunia now has is to be sworn to a peer of the Imperium such as a Knightly house or a chapter of the Adeptus Astartes. It has certainly shown that it is worthy of such.

## Mission 1 – The Bounty of Ilarion
Ever since you boarded the Bounty of Ilarion, you have been sifting through communiques and missives trying to pin down the location of an adversary that is almost certainly working to stabilize relations with the Imperium. It is equally likely that they have anticipated your arrival. It is critical that you break through and establish a base for more of your forces to follow.

*Mance sat in the Bounty of Ilarion and pondered the circumstances that had brought him here. This was a curious mission indeed: A Jarl of the great chapter Wolves of Fenris secretly infiltrating a planet of the empire to assist the Lord Governor in his rebellion against the empire. Mance shook his head in disbelief.*  

*But the Adeptus Mechanicus were pillaging the worlds of this system and the ones suffering were civilians. And actions like that do not sit well with Wolf Lord Ragnar Blackmane.*  

*So here they were. To call his kill team minimal would have been an overstatement. The Wolf Lord obviously couldn't send a sizeable force of the Great Company as the diplomatic consequences for the chapter would have been backbreaking. Mance grimaced. Big picture be damned, he was the one flying to war with only five warriors.*  

*Mance let his eyes wander across the familiar faces of his companions. At least he was in good company! Loboda and Styr were his battle-hardened and loyal Huskarls. Mance fought along them for years and would trust them with his life in a heartbeat. The lone Nightrunner was a professional. He wouldn’t catch a bullet for you, but he knew his orders and was trained to follow them. And that was good enough for Mance. Then there was Orell. The Wulfen are a strange pack! One is never quite at ease in their company. "I suppose, it’s better to have him on our side than the other way round", Mance mused, as the ships com suddenly burst into life.*  

*"Beginning descend upon Fortalessa. We drop you off near the worlds hive primus Agavar. Establish a base of operation quickly and identify any possible opposition. It is vital that you keep a low profile. For Russ and the Allfather!"*  

*And with that the mission to liberate Fortalessa from the Emerpor's bane entered the critical phase.*
