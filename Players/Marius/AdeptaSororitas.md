# Adepta Sororitas
## Order Conviction: Valorous Heart
> When a model with this conviction would lose a
wound, roll one D6; on a 6 that wound is not lost.
In addition, when resolving an attack made with a
weapon with an Armour Penetration characteristic
of -1 against a unit with this conviction, that
weapon has an Armour Penetration characteristic of
0 for that attack. Whilst a unit with this conviction
is under the effect of an Imagifier’s Tale of the
Stoic ability, weapons with an Armour Penetration
characteristic of -2 are also treated as having an
Armour Penetration characteristic of 0 when
resolving attacks against that unit.

## ACTS OF FAITH
> Through the prayers of the faithful is the
Emperor’s will made manifest.
If your army contains at least one unit with
this ability, you can perform one Act of
Faith in each phase. To do so, you will use
Miracle dice.
Gaining Miracle Dice
You gain one Miracle dice at the beginning
of each battle round, and you gain one at
the end of a phase if one or more of the
following conditions are met one or more
times during that phase:
Vengeance: A unit from your army with the
Acts of Faith ability destroys an enemy unit.
Sacrifice: A CHARACTER unit from
your army with the Acts of Faith ability
is destroyed.
Purity: A psychic power is resisted by a
unit from your army with the Acts of Faith
ability (without performing an Act of Faith
to do so, as described below).
Valour: You roll an unmodified 1 for a
Morale test taken for a unit with the Acts of
Faith ability (without performing an Act of
Faith to do so, as described below).
When you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6.
The number you roll is the value of that
Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed
unless a rule states otherwise. Keep your
Miracle dice to one side – this is your
Miracle dice pool.
Performing an Act of Faith
Before making a dice roll for a model or
unit from your army with the Acts of Faith
ability, you can choose to use one or more
of the dice from your Miracle dice pool
instead. For each individual dice that is
being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can
select one Miracle dice from your Miracle
dice pool to be substituted in place of that
dice. The dice that it is being substituted for
is not rolled, and instead the value of the
chosen Miracle dice is used as if it had been
rolled. Once all Miracle dice substitutions
have been made, remove the chosen
Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool,
and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice
that are a part of the dice roll.
You can use Miracle dice to perform an Act
of Faith for any of the following types of
dice roll:
• Advance roll
• Charge roll
• Deny the Witch test
• Hit roll
• Wound roll
• Saving throw
• Damage roll
• Morale test
For example, instead of rolling a D6 to
see what value is added to a unit’s Move
characteristic when that unit Advances, you
could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool.
If the value of that dice was 5, you would
add 5" to the Move characteristic of all
models in the unit for that Movement phase.
A Miracle dice is not a modifier or an
inherently modified dice (so, for example,
if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1
for a Morale test, that is considered to be
an unmodified roll of 1).
When re-rolling a dice roll, no new Miracle
dice may be substituted. The number and
values of any Miracle dice that have already
been substituted in the dice roll remain the
same for the re-roll.

## SACRED RITES
The Adepta Sororitas pray for the Emperor to guide them and fill
them with strength.
If every unit in your army has the ADEPTA SORORITAS and/or
ADEPTUS MINISTORUM Faction keywords, this unit gains an
ability depending on which Sacred Rite is active for your army.
Determine which Sacred Rite is active for all units from your
army with this ability at the start of the battle. To do so, after
deployment, but before the first battle round begins, select one
Sacred Rite from the following table to be active. Alternatively, you
can roll two D6 to randomly generate two Sacred Rites to be active
(a duplicate result has no additional effect, but is considered to be
active for the purposes of the Battle Rites Stratagem). In either case,
Sacred Rites are active until the end of the battle.

| D6 | Sacred Rite | Effect |
| - | - | - | 
| 1 | Hand of the Emperor | Add 1 to the Advance roll. Add 1 to the charge roll. |
| 2 | Spirit of the Martyr | When a model with this Sacred Rite is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing the model from play. On a 5+ that model can either shoot with one of its ranged weapons |
| 3 | Aegis of the Emperor | When a Deny the Witch test is taken for a unit with this Sacred Rite, add 3 to the total. |
| 4 | Divine Guidance | When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, on an unmodified wound roll of 6 the Armour Penetration characteristic of that weapon is improved by 1 for that attack (e.g. AP 0 becomes AP -1). |
| 5 | The Passion | When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, an unmodified hit roll of 6 scores 1 additional hit. |
| 6 | Light of the Emperor | When a Morale test is taken for a unit with this Sacred Rite, you can re-roll the dice. |

## SHIELD OF FAITH: 
> Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save.

## ZEALOT:
> When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by a model in this unit, you can re-roll the hit roll if that model’s unit made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn.
