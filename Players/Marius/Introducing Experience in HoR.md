# Introducing Experience in HoR

## Question: Why do we need experience?

The answer is quite simple:
We don't need it ... but it's more fun :)

A campaign becomes more engaging if you have characters that earned their advances the hard way than just bought new stuff.
Also HoR as it is right now does not incentivice buying Battle Honors. 
In most cases it seems to be the better choice to buy new bodies or new equipment for existing troops. 

## Question: What would you get for your experience?

As we don't want to reinvent the wheel and create more imbalance to the game, we should pick something that already exists.
The obvious choice:
#### Battle Honors
Instead of being able to buy them with RPs, they can be "bought" with XP.

## Question: Who gains experience?

Gaining experience means additional book keeping. So not every teeny tiny soldier should gain experience.
Rather only elite soldiers should:

#### Heros 
#### Special choices

This limits the book keeping to 4/5 soldiers.

## Question: How do you gain experience?

This is the tricky part...
We need to balance XP so that it is spreaded over a variaty of possibilities.
But we need to make sure that XP is not gained is masses so Battle Honors are something rather special than common.
Though there has to be enough XP so a character can gain 2-3 Honors in a campaign. Any less and it become too irrelevant.
