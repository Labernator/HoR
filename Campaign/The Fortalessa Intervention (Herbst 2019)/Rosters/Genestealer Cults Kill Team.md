## Genestealer Cults    
<ins>**Kill Team Special Rules**</ins>  
**Unquesting Loyalty**  
If you fail a saving throw for a **<CULT> CHARACTER** model, or a **<CULT> CHARACTER** model suffers a mortal wound, if it is within 3" of any friendly **<CULT>** or **BROOD BROTHERS** model with this ability roll a D6. On a 4+ you do not inflict any damage on the character, but the model is slain.

**Cult Ambush**  
During deployment, you can set up this model in ambush instead of on the battlefield. If it has the **INFANTRY** or **BIKER** keyword, you can either set it up in ambush or underground instead of on the battlefield.

When you set up a unit underground, it can emerge at the end of any of your Movement phases – set the unit up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" from any enemy models.

When you set up a unit in ambush, place one ambush marker anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within your deployment zone. You will need one ambush marker for each unit that will deploy in this way.

**Cult Creeds: The Twisted Helix**  
All **<Cult>** models except Purestrain Genestealers gain: Add 1 to the Strength characteristic (included in profile) and add 2 to Advance rolls.
