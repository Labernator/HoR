# Introducing Experience in HoR

## Question: Why do we need experience?

The answer is quite simple:
We don't need it ... but it's more fun :)

A campaign becomes more engaging if you have characters that earned their advances the hard way than just bought new stuff.
Also HoR as it is right now does not incentivice buying Battle Honors. 
In most cases it seems to be the better choice to buy new bodies or new equipment for existing troops. 

## Question: What would you get for your experience?

As we don't want to reinvent the wheel and create more imbalance to the game, we should pick something that already exists.
The obvious choice:

#### Battle Honors
Instead of being able to buy them with RPs, they can be "bought" with XP. 
Battle Honors that cost more than 8, can only be bought by the Leader.

##### The only exceptions are Team Honors. These can still only be purchased with requisition points. 

## Question: Who gains experience?

Up to 3 Soldiers can be chosen which can accumulate experience. One of them has to be the Leader.

## Question: How do you gain experience?

#### Took part in a battle: +1XP
#### Survived the battle: +1XP
#### Each enemy model killed: +1XP

Up to half of the victory points (rounded down) can be converted to experience (and thus not be used to generate requisition points).
These extra XP can be distributed as you wish.


## Idee Stefan  
- Es gibt pro Warband 3 Modelle die XP erhalten können. Diese können frei gewählt werden. Jeder Leader muss gewählt werden.
- 1XP für Teilnahme, 1XP für Überleben, 1XP pro Kill für jedes Modell
- Die Hälfte (abgerundet) der erspielten VPs können in XP umgewandelt und frei verteilt werden.
- Battle Honors werden statt mit VP mit XP bezahlt. Nur Leader können Honors erwerben die mehr als 8 XP kosten.
