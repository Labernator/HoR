# The Karnemak Incident  
From the memoirs of Abrocor Silanius, Stratego to Lord General Judex Gage, 3rd commander of Imperial Forces during the Espenæs Crusade.   
*'The Karnemak incident. The Incident at Black Sword. The most bizarre event in a 60 year crusade. We were engaged in fleet/ground operations against the enemy over the hive world of Zagris Tertius. We had just landed a huge force planetside, including over a million men and a score of tank companies. That was when the Hulk appeared. Imperial designation ‘Obelisk of Cataclysm’ was on our augurs for 9.9 standard minutes and in that time, all of our vox traffic turned into a horrendous howling and baying. 9.9 minutes is a blink of an eye in void combat and the ships in orbit saw little destabilization at the command and control breakdown, but the situation on the ground must have been quite different. When the hulk disappeared, we were unable to re-establish vox connection with ground forces and surface augurs showed that all forces were in severe disarray. 12 hours, 28 standard minutes later, a single vox signal came through.'*  
 
My name is Inquisitor Baldasar Drakeholm. Zagris Tertius is hereby declared Perditus et Fatalis. You are to immediately and emphatically destroy any transport currently undertaking from the surface of this world. The fleet is to perform an emergency translation to fallback point 322 zeta for consolidation.  

*'That was all we got. No one knew what fallback point 322 zeta was, but someone had uploaded it to the navigation cogitators. I won’t say what happened there, but from that day forth, every ship had a contingent of Imperial Inquisition operating in the open on board and over a hundred agents that I know of deployed with our ground forces over the course of the campaign.'*
