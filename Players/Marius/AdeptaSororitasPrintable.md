### Kill Team Special Rules:
**<Order>**
> Each model with the <Order> keyword benefits from the order conviction.
 Selected Order: Valorous Heart
 
**Order Conviction - Stoic Endurance**
> When a model with this conviction would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 6 that wound is not lost.
In addition, when resolving an attack made with a weapon with an Armour Penetration characteristic
of -1 against a unit with this conviction, that
weapon has an Armour Penetration characteristic of
0 for that attack. Whilst a unit with this conviction
is under the effect of an Imagifier’s Tale of the
Stoic ability, weapons with an Armour Penetration
characteristic of -2 are also treated as having an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0 when
resolving attacks against that unit.

**Zealot**
> When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by this model, you can re-roll the hit roll if that model made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn.

**Shield of Faith**
> This model has a 6+ invulnerable save.

**Sacred Rites**
> Determine which Sacred Rite is active for all units from your
army with this ability at the start of the battle. To do so, after
deployment, but before the first battle round begins, select one Sacred Rite from the following table to be active. Alternatively, you
can roll two D6 to randomly generate two Sacred Rites to be active
(a duplicate result has no additional effect, but is considered to be
active for the purposes of the Battle Rites Stratagem). In either case,
Sacred Rites are active until the end of the battle.

| D6 | SACRED RITE | EFFECT |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Hand of the Emperor | When a model with this Sacred Rite Advances, or charges add 1 to the respective roll. 
| 2 | Spirit of the Martyr | When a model with this Sacred Rite is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing the model from play. On a 5+ that model can either shoot with one of its ranged weapons as if it were your Shooting phase, or make one attack with one of its melee weapons as if it were the Fight phase (if the model has a damage table, use the bottom row of that table when shooting with that ranged weapon or resolving that attack with a melee weapon). |
| 3 | Aegis of the Emperor | When a Deny the Witch test is taken for a model with this Sacred Rite, add 3 to the total. |
| 4 | Divine Guidance | When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, on an unmodified wound roll of 6 the Armour Penetration characteristic of that weapon is improved by 1 for that attack (e.g. AP 0 becomes AP -1).
| 5 | The Passion | When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by a model with this Sacred Rite, an unmodified hit roll of 6 scores 1 additional hit.
| 6 | Light of the Emperor | When a Morale test is taken for a model with this Sacred Rite, you can re-roll the dice. |

**Incensor Cherub - 5 points** 

> An Incensor Cherub is represented by a model on the battlefield that has the FLY keyword, a 9” Move and the
ability to Advance. It cannot do anything else. It can be moved and targeted freely through, even occupying the same space as other models, and cannot be affected or targeted by any in-game rules or abilities except the following: Once per battle at the beginning of a phase, if it is within 3” of a friendly Adepta Sororitas model the cherub can intercede. Immediately remove the cherub from the battlefield and generate a Miracle Dice, rolling 2D6 and choosing the result to keep. That miracle dice can only be used during the current phase and only for an Act of Faith for a model within 3” of the cherub’s last location.
