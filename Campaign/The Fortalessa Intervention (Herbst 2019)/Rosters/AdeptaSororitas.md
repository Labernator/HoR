# Holy Warriors of the one God

### Kill Team Special Rules:
**Order = Valorous Heart**
> Order Convictions:When a model with this conviction would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 6 that wound is not lost.
In addition, when resolving an attack made with a weapon with an Armour Penetration characteristic
of -1 against a unit with this conviction, that
weapon has an Armour Penetration characteristic of
0 for that attack. Whilst a unit with this conviction
is under the effect of an Imagifier’s Tale of the
Stoic ability, weapons with an Armour Penetration
characteristic of -2 are also treated as having an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0 when
resolving attacks against that unit.
